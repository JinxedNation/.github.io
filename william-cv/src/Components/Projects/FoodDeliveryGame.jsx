                    <h2>Brief</h2>
                        <p>Contributed to the development of "The Food Delivery Game,"a fast-paced game implemented using C++ and OpenGL</p>
                        <p>The game challenges players to accurately collect and promptly deliver food items to a Finite State Machine (FSM), scoring based on order correctness and delivery speed.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h2>Challenges</h2>
                        <p>Successfully navigated through project management hurdles and maintained effective team communication during Covid-19 constraints.</p>
                        <p>Provided assistance to team members struggling with code-related and personal issues, ensuring a cohesive and supportive work environment.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h2>Technical Proficiencies & Achievements</h2>
                        <p>Gained a deeper understanding of C++ and game logic implementation by enhancing and refactoring existing legacy code.</p>
                        <p>utilized data structures like linked lists for game objects</p>
                        <p>Applied physics principles to implement bounding boxes and sphres for collision detection within 3D environments</p>
                        <p>Developed and managed Finite State Machines for controlling NPCs, incorporating mechanisms like basic Z, X plane movement, spawning, and colour change.</p>
                        <p>Implemented game timers to regulate the pace and challenge of the game</p>
                        <p>Designed an intuitive user interface with pause/play functionality, significantly enhancing user experience.</p>
